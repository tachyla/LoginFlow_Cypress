Thank you, Airtable team for allowing me the opportunity to interview for this role. 
My name is TaChyla Murray and I thrive in roles where I'm able to combine my
7 years experience manual testing with my ability to write JavaScript code. I found
this take home assessment as an exciting opportunity to push the envelope and learn innovative testing
methodology. In my Lyft role, I frequently used Espresso testing framework and Java to contribute Android automated tests. 
This was my first time implementing Cypress, and it really challenged me but relying 
on my Javascript experience helped me to successfully write one automation test mocking the Sign Up Flow.
